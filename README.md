The code for the analysis found in the Results-section of my project thesis. 

Files:
- Geometric_distortion_BW.ipynb: The analysis don eon the shifting of boundaries for varying bandwidths.
- Manual_segmentation.ipynb: The method used to manually define the ROIs for the project. This file only provides an overview of the method, and if used the input for the functions must be altered to the specific images you want to define a ROI to.
- Signal_loss_TE.ipynb: Analysis of the effect of increasing Echo Time (TE) on the severity of signal loss.
- Signal_loss_dz: Analysis of the effect of increasing the slice thickenss on the severity of signal loss.
